# Shap Recognition

Ouline:

The inital goal is to be able to determine if a shape is a rectangle or a circle.

Initially, I will tell the program what characteristics are of a square and a circle. Future state will hopefully be able to process a whole bunch of images and determine what shape they represent.

## Square

we want to be able to identify the *straight* lines that make up the edge of the square
